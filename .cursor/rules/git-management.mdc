# Git Management

The AI manages Git for this project. Follow these rules:

## Branching
- Work on `main` by default. Create branches only for large, isolated features.
- Pull from `origin/main` before starting work when remote may have changes.

## Committing
- **Only commit when the user explicitly says "commit"** (or equivalent).
- When a feature or logical chunk of work is complete, prompt: "This looks like a good place to commit. Say 'commit' when you're ready and I'll stage and push."
- Use clear, descriptive commit messages (e.g., "Add CIP-in-gaps validation", "Fix Gantt viewer date parsing").

## Before Commits
- Run `git status` and `git diff` to verify what will be committed.
- Avoid committing debug output, temp files, or secrets (respect `.gitignore`).

## Pushing
- Push to `origin main` after commits, unless the user requests otherwise.
- If push fails (auth, conflicts), explain the issue and next steps.
